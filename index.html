    <p>Resources for the 'Self-Driving Cars' Creative Computing Club.</p>
    <p>This page recaps what <a href="https://bit.ly/Jun23CCC" target="_blank">we discussed as a group</a>.</p>
    <p>To skip to the advanced extensions, <a href="#radio">click here</a>.</p>

  </div>

  <div id="starter" class="left">
    <h3>Creating your first program</h3>
    <p>- testing the microbit with a picture - use the editor & practice downloading</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="buggies" class="left">
    <h3>Testing the cars</h3>
    <p>- code set up so that they will drive forward if they're over the line, and stop if they go off it</p>
    <p>- test your car, how far can it go before it drives off?</p>
    <p>- edit the number in the brackets (forward(100)) to test driving for longer or shorter - what do you think works best?</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="smart" class="left">
    <h3>Making them smart</h3>
    <p>- they should be able to turn corners and keep following the lines</p>
    <p>- elif left_sensor</p>
    <p>- elif right_sensor</p>
    <p>- test out your car on the roads - how well can it cope with the corners?</p>
    <p>- reduce how far it travels before checking the sensors; reduce the speed of the car when turning...</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="radio" class="left">
    <h3>Designing a smart road system</h3>
    <p>- this part is challenging, an extension for those who have been before</p>
    <p>- using radio to listen out for stop signals, take a 'pedestrian crossing'</p>
    <p>- add 'while message says go' and adjust the indents</p>
    <p>- when this is working, further extension is to adjust the code on the crossing - how long should it stop the cars for before letting them drive again? how long after pressing the crossing should it wait before telling the cars to stop? how long after telling the cars to stop should it wait before letting the pedestrian know that it is safe to cross (consider the delay in stopping)?</p>
    <p>ALL OF THIS SECTION AS A HANDOUT / PAGE WITH GIFS SHOWING THE INDENTS</p>
    <p>Other extension possibilities: coding traffic light LEDs</p>
